# Setting Up Your First Garden

After installing SowTempo, the first step is configuring your location and growing season. This information helps SowTempo calculate accurate planting dates and provide relevant weather data.

## Initial Setup Wizard

When you first launch SowTempo, you'll see the setup wizard. This takes about 2 minutes to complete.

![Setup Wizard](/img/screenshots/setup-wizard.png)

### Step 1: Set Your Location

Enter your location to get accurate frost dates and weather data:

1. **By ZIP Code (US only):** Enter your 5-digit ZIP code
2. **By City:** Search for your city name
3. **Manual coordinates:** Enter latitude and longitude directly

SowTempo uses your location to:

- Look up historical frost dates from NOAA data
- Determine your USDA Hardiness Zone
- Fetch local weather forecasts

![Location Setup](/img/screenshots/setup-location.png)

:::tip
Your location is stored locally and only used to fetch weather from Open-Meteo. We never collect or store your location data.
:::

### Step 2: Confirm Frost Dates

Based on your location, SowTempo suggests frost dates:

- **Last Spring Frost:** The date after which frost is unlikely
- **First Fall Frost:** The date when frost becomes likely again

These dates are critical for calculating when to start seeds, transplant, and harvest.

You can accept the suggested dates or adjust them based on your local microclimate. Gardeners in:

- **Low-lying areas** may want later spring / earlier fall dates
- **Urban heat islands** may have a longer frost-free season
- **Elevated or exposed locations** may need more conservative dates

### Step 3: Choose Measurement Units

Select your preferred units:

| Setting      | Options                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Measurements | Imperial (feet, inches) or Metric (meters, cm) |
| Temperature  | Fahrenheit or Celsius                          |
| Weight       | Pounds or Kilograms                            |

You can change these anytime in Settings.

### Step 4: Create Your First Season

A **growing season** in SowTempo represents one year's gardening activities. All your plantings, harvests, and records are organized by season.

Enter:

- **Season name:** e.g., "2025 Garden" or "Spring/Summer 2025"
- **Year:** The calendar year for this season

![Create Season](/img/screenshots/setup-create-season.png)

:::info
You can have multiple seasons (for tracking year-over-year data) and switch between them anytime. Only one season is "active" at a time.

## After Setup: Your Dashboard

Once setup is complete, you'll land on the **Dashboard** — your garden's home base.

![Dashboard After Setup](/img/screenshots/dashboard-empty.png)

From here, you can:

1. **Add your first planting** — Click the + button or go to Planting Schedule
2. **Design your garden layout** — Open Garden Layout to draw beds
3. **Explore the plant database** — Browse Vegetables to discover what to grow

## What's Next?

Now that SowTempo is configured, you're ready to start planning:

### Option A: Start with Plants

If you already know what you want to grow:

1. Go to **Planting Schedule**
2. Click **Add Planting**
3. Search for your vegetable and variety
4. SowTempo calculates when to plant based on your frost dates

### Option B: Start with Layout

If you want to design your physical garden first:

1. Go to **Garden Layout**
2. Draw your garden beds
3. Add plant placements to beds
4. Plantings can be created from placements

### Option C: Explore First

Not sure what to grow?

1. Go to **Vegetables**
2. Browse nearly 4,000 varieties
3. Filter by frost tolerance, days to maturity, or category
4. Add promising plants to your schedule

## Adjusting Settings Later

You can change any setup options in **Settings**:

- **Location & Climate** — Update location, frost dates, hardiness zone
- **Units & Display** — Change measurement units
- **Seasons** — Create new seasons or modify existing ones

## Tips for Getting Started

1. **Start small** — Begin with a few plantings rather than planning your entire garden at once
2. **Use the database** — Browse varieties to find plants suited to your climate
3. **Trust the dates** — SowTempo's frost-based calculations are based on NOAA historical data
4. **Track everything** — The more you record, the more useful your analytics become
