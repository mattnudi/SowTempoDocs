# Understanding Frost Dates

Frost dates are the foundation of garden timing. This guide explains what they are, how SowTempo uses them, and how to work with them effectively.

## What Are Frost Dates?

**Frost dates** indicate when frost is likely in your area:

- **Last Spring Frost** — The date after which frost is unlikely to occur
- **First Fall Frost** — The date when frost becomes likely again

The period between these dates is your **frost-free growing season**.

## How Frost Dates Drive Planting

SowTempo uses your frost dates to calculate when to plant:

### Last Frost Date

Used for spring planting:

- **Seed start dates** — Count back from transplant date
- **Transplant dates** — Based on frost tolerance
- **Direct sow dates** — When soil is warm enough

### First Frost Date

Used for fall planning:

- **Last planting dates** — Time needed to mature before frost
- **Harvest deadlines** — For frost-sensitive crops
- **Fall planting timing** — For cold-hardy crops

## Frost Tolerance Levels

Plants have different cold hardiness:

| Tolerance       | Meaning                | Planting Timing             | Examples                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Very Hardy**  | Survives hard frost    | 4-6 weeks before last frost | Spinach, garlic, peas     |
| **Hardy**       | Tolerates light frost  | 2-4 weeks before last frost | Kale, broccoli, cabbage   |
| **Half Hardy**  | Survives brief frost   | Around last frost           | Lettuce, beets, chard     |
| **Tender**      | Damaged by light frost | After last frost            | Beans, corn, squash       |
| **Very Tender** | Killed by any frost    | 2+ weeks after last frost   | Tomatoes, peppers, melons |

SowTempo automatically adjusts planting dates based on each plant's frost tolerance.

## Understanding Frost Date Probability

NOAA frost dates come in three probability levels:

| Probability      | Meaning                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **10% (Risky)**  | 90% chance frost has passed — aggressive timing   |
| **50% (Median)** | 50/50 chance — standard timing                    |
| **90% (Safe)**   | 90% chance frost has passed — conservative timing |

SowTempo uses the **median (50%)** dates by default. You can adjust based on your risk tolerance.

### When to Use Different Probabilities

| Situation                               | Recommendation            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| New gardener                            | Use safe (90%) dates      |
| Experienced, watching weather           | Use median (50%) dates    |
| Protected garden / row covers available | Can use risky (10%) dates |
| Expensive transplants                   | Use safe dates            |
| Direct sowing (can replant easily)      | Can use median dates      |

## Where Frost Dates Come From

SowTempo uses NOAA's 1991-2020 Climate Normals:

- **6,948 weather stations** across the US
- **30 years of data** for statistical accuracy
- **Multiple probability levels** for flexibility

The data includes:

- Spring last frost dates (10%, 50%, 90% probability)
- Fall first frost dates (10%, 50%, 90% probability)

## Setting Frost Dates in SowTempo

### Auto-Lookup by Location

1. Go to **Settings > Location & Climate**
2. Enter your ZIP code
3. Click **Look Up**
4. Frost dates auto-fill from NOAA data

### Manual Override

If you know your microclimate differs:

1. Go to **Settings > Location & Climate**
2. Click the date field for frost dates
3. Select **Manual** mode
4. Enter your preferred dates
5. Save

### When to Override

Consider overriding if:

- You're in an **urban heat island** (often warmer)
- Your garden is in a **frost pocket** (colder)
- You have **wind protection** (walls, hedges)
- You're at a **different elevation** than the weather station
- Your local experience differs from the averages

## Working with Microclimates

Your garden may be warmer or colder than regional averages:

### Signs of a Warm Microclimate

- South-facing slope
- Protected by buildings
- Near concrete/pavement (absorbs heat)
- Good air drainage (cold air flows away)

**Adjust:** Use last frost 1-2 weeks earlier

### Signs of a Cold Microclimate

- North-facing slope
- Low-lying area (cold air pools)
- Exposed to wind
- Shaded or near water

**Adjust:** Use last frost 1-2 weeks later

## Frost Protection Strategies

When frost threatens sensitive plants:

### Cover Crops

- Row covers (floating fabric)
- Cloches (individual covers)
- Cold frames
- Plastic tunnels

### Emergency Protection

- Sheets or blankets
- Buckets or containers inverted over plants
- Straw mulch around base

### Watering Strategy

Water soil before frost — wet soil holds more heat than dry.

## Extending Your Season

Push beyond your frost dates:

### Spring Extension

Start earlier with:

- Cold frames or low tunnels
- Wall o' Water plant protectors
- Cold-tolerant varieties
- Hardening off transplants

### Fall Extension

Harvest later with:

- Row covers for frost protection
- Choosing frost-tolerant late crops
- Mulching root crops for in-ground storage

## Frost Alerts in SowTempo

SowTempo watches the weather and warns you:

### How Alerts Work

- Weather data checked regularly
- When low temperature forecast < 36°F (2°C)
- Frost Alert appears on Dashboard
- Lists affected frost-sensitive plantings

### Responding to Alerts

1. Check the forecast details
2. Identify at-risk plants
3. Take protective action
4. Update planting status if damage occurs

## Tracking Actual Frost Dates

Record actual frost events for future reference:

### Logging Observations

1. Create a **Journal Entry** when frost occurs
2. Tag it with "frost" or "weather"
3. Note which plants were affected
4. Record damage levels

### Year-Over-Year Comparison

Use Analytics to compare:

- Predicted vs. actual frost dates
- Impact on your harvests
- Season length variations

## Tips for Frost Date Success

1. **Know your zone** — But know frost dates matter more
2. **Watch the weather** — Forecasts beat averages
3. **Track your experience** — Your data beats regional data
4. **Have covers ready** — Protect investment plants
5. **Be patient** — Waiting a week beats replanting
