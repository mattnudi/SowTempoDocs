# Companion Planting

Companion planting is the practice of growing certain plants together for mutual benefit. This guide covers companion planting principles and how to apply them in your SowTempo garden.

## What Is Companion Planting?

Plants can help each other through:

- **Pest deterrence** — Some plants repel specific pests
- **Pollinator attraction** — Flowers bring beneficial insects
- **Nutrient sharing** — Legumes fix nitrogen for neighbors
- **Physical support** — Tall plants shade or support others
- **Space efficiency** — Different root depths share soil

## Classic Companion Combinations

### The Three Sisters

The most famous companion planting:

| Plant  | Role                                            |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Corn   | Provides structure for beans to climb           |
| Beans  | Fix nitrogen, support corn growth               |
| Squash | Shades ground, deters pests with prickly leaves |

### Tomato Companions

Good partners for tomatoes:

| Companion | Benefit                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Basil     | Repels aphids, may improve flavor |
| Carrots   | Loosen soil, different root zone  |
| Marigolds | Deter nematodes and aphids        |
| Parsley   | Attracts beneficial insects       |

### Brassica Companions

Partners for cabbage, broccoli, kale:

| Companion   | Benefit                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Onions      | Deter cabbage worms       |
| Dill        | Attracts beneficial wasps |
| Nasturtiums | Trap crop for aphids      |
| Thyme       | Deters cabbage worms      |

## Plants to Keep Apart

Some plants inhibit each other:

| Avoid Planting Together  | Reason                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Tomatoes + Brassicas     | Compete for nutrients     |
| Beans + Onions/Garlic    | Alliums inhibit beans     |
| Carrots + Dill           | Cross-pollination issues  |
| Fennel + Most vegetables | Inhibits many plants      |
| Corn + Tomatoes          | Both attract corn earworm |

## Using Companions in SowTempo

### Planning in Garden Layout

When placing plants:

1. Open **Garden Layout**
2. Consider bed neighbors
3. Place companions together
4. Separate antagonists

### Visualizing Companions

Use color coding or naming to identify companion groups:

- Name placements with companion notes
- Use Journal to document companion experiments

### Tracking Results

Record companion planting outcomes:

- Which combinations worked?
- Observed pest differences?
- Yield impacts?

Use Journal entries with the tag "companion planting" for easy reference.

## Beneficial Flowers

Include flowers in your vegetable garden:

| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Marigolds     | Deter nematodes, aphids, whiteflies   |
| Nasturtiums   | Trap crop for aphids, edible          |
| Sunflowers    | Attract pollinators, provide shade    |
| Calendula     | Attract beneficial insects            |
| Borage        | Attracts bees, deters tomato hornworm |
| Sweet Alyssum | Attracts beneficial wasps             |

## Companion Planting Strategies

### Border Planting

Plant companions around bed edges:

- Marigolds around tomato bed
- Basil interplanted with tomatoes
- Onions at brassica bed edges

### Interplanting

Mix companions within the bed:

- Carrots between onion rows
- Lettuce under tall crops
- Radishes as row markers

### Trap Cropping

Sacrifice plants attract pests away:

- Nasturtiums draw aphids from vegetables
- Blue Hubbard squash attracts squash bugs
- Mustard greens lure flea beetles

### Nurse Cropping

Fast crops protect slow ones:

- Radishes mark carrot rows
- Lettuce shades young tomato transplants
- Quick crops use space while slow crops establish

## The Science Reality

Companion planting is part tradition, part science:

### Well-Supported

- Legumes fix nitrogen
- Flowers attract pollinators
- Strong scents can confuse pests
- Physical barriers work

### Mixed Evidence

- "Flavor improvement" claims
- Specific pest deterrence
- Growth enhancement

### Experiment Yourself

- Try companions in your garden
- Keep one bed as control
- Record observations
- Draw your own conclusions

## Tips for Companion Planting

1. **Don't overcomplicate** — Start with a few proven combinations
2. **Space appropriately** — Companions still need room
3. **Consider timing** — Partners should share similar seasons
4. **Record results** — Use Journal to track what works
5. **Be skeptical** — Not all claims are proven
