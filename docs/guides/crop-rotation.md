# Crop Rotation

Crop rotation means changing what you grow in each bed from year to year. This practice improves soil health and reduces pest and disease problems. This guide explains rotation principles and how to plan rotations in SowTempo.

## Why Rotate Crops?

### Break Disease Cycles

Soil-borne diseases build up when the same crops grow in the same place:

- Tomato blight overwinters in soil
- Club root affects brassicas
- Rotating starves these pathogens

### Reduce Pest Pressure

Pests overwinter where their food was:

- Colorado potato beetles emerge where potatoes grew
- Moving crops forces pests to find new food

### Balance Soil Nutrients

Different crops have different needs:

- Heavy feeders deplete nitrogen
- Legumes add nitrogen back
- Rotation balances demand

### Improve Soil Structure

Different root systems work different soil layers:

- Deep roots break up compaction
- Fibrous roots add organic matter
- Diversity builds better soil

## Plant Families for Rotation

Rotate by plant family — members share pests and diseases:

| Family            | Crops                                 | Key Concerns                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Solanaceae**    | Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, potatoes | Blight, hornworms           |
| **Brassicaceae**  | Broccoli, cabbage, kale, radishes     | Club root, cabbage worms    |
| **Cucurbitaceae** | Squash, cucumbers, melons             | Powdery mildew, squash bugs |
| **Fabaceae**      | Beans, peas                           | Add nitrogen                |
| **Alliaceae**     | Onions, garlic, leeks                 | Onion maggots               |
| **Asteraceae**    | Lettuce, artichokes                   | Few issues, flexible        |
| **Apiaceae**      | Carrots, celery, parsley              | Carrot rust fly             |

## Basic Rotation Plan

A simple 4-year rotation:

| Year | Bed 1        | Bed 2        | Bed 3        | Bed 4        |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1    | Legumes      | Brassicas    | Solanaceae   | Roots/Others |
| 2    | Brassicas    | Solanaceae   | Roots/Others | Legumes      |
| 3    | Solanaceae   | Roots/Others | Legumes      | Brassicas    |
| 4    | Roots/Others | Legumes      | Brassicas    | Solanaceae   |

Each family returns to the same bed every 4 years.

## Rotation Rules

### Minimum Gap

How long before returning to the same spot:

| Family     | Minimum Gap | Ideal Gap |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Solanaceae | 3 years     | 4+ years  |
| Brassicas  | 3 years     | 4 years   |
| Alliums    | 2 years     | 3 years   |
| Cucurbits  | 2 years     | 3 years   |
| Legumes    | 2 years     | Flexible  |

### Follow Legumes

Legumes fix nitrogen. Follow them with:

- Heavy feeders (tomatoes, corn, squash)
- Leafy greens that need nitrogen

### Avoid Same-Family Sequences

Never follow:

- Tomatoes with potatoes
- Broccoli with cabbage
- Cucumbers with squash

## Planning Rotations in SowTempo

### Using Multiple Seasons

1. Create seasons for multiple years
2. Track what grew where each year
3. Review bed history before planting

### Bed Timeline Feature

In Garden Layout:

1. Select a bed
2. Click **View Timeline**
3. See what was planted in previous seasons
4. Plan accordingly

### Naming Beds Consistently

Keep bed names consistent across seasons:

- "Raised Bed 1" every year
- Don't rename between seasons
- Enables accurate history tracking

### Journal Documentation

Record rotation decisions:

- Why you chose each location
- Problems you're trying to solve
- Results from previous rotations

## Rotation Strategies

### Heavy/Light Feeder Rotation

Based on nutrient needs:

| Year | Strategy                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Heavy feeders (tomatoes, corn) — add compost     |
| 2    | Medium feeders (root crops) — residual nutrients |
| 3    | Light feeders (beans, herbs) — build nitrogen    |
| 4    | Leafy greens — use accumulated nitrogen          |

### Cover Crop Integration

Include cover crops in rotation:

| Season        | Crop                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Spring/Summer | Vegetables               |
| Fall/Winter   | Cover crop (clover, rye) |
| Next Spring   | Incorporate, then plant  |

### Small Garden Adaptation

With limited beds:

- Still rotate as much as possible
- Focus on high-priority families (solanaceae, brassicas)
- Use containers for problem crops
- Accept imperfect rotation over none

## Common Rotation Mistakes

### Problem: Ignoring Potatoes

Potatoes are solanaceae:

- Rotate with tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- Don't follow or precede them

### Problem: Radishes Overlooked

Radishes are brassicas:

- Include them in brassica rotation
- Easy to forget as a "quick crop"

### Problem: Breaking Rotation

"Just this once" leads to problems:

- Disease pressure accumulates
- One violation can undo years of benefit
- Find a different spot or skip the crop

### Problem: Herbs Ignored

Many herbs have family ties:

- Dill, cilantro, parsley = Apiaceae (with carrots)
- Basil = Lamiaceae (usually flexible)
- Include in rotation planning

## Benefits You'll See

### After 2-3 Years

- Fewer pest problems
- Less disease pressure
- Improved yields

### After 4+ Years

- Better soil structure
- More consistent production
- Reduced input needs

## Tips for Successful Rotation

1. **Draw a map** — Track locations year to year
2. **Keep records** — Use SowTempo's bed timeline
3. **Plan ahead** — Know next year's rotation now
4. **Stay flexible** — Adapt to problems
5. **Think family** — Group crops correctly
