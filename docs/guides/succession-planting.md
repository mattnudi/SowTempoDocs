# Succession Planting

Succession planting means sowing the same crop multiple times throughout the season. Instead of harvesting everything at once, you get a continuous supply. This guide shows how to plan and track succession plantings in SowTempo.

## Why Succession Plant?

### Spread the Harvest

One planting produces one harvest window:

| Single Planting       | Result                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Lettuce sowed April 1 | Harvest late May — too much at once |
| Beans sowed May 15    | Harvest July — then nothing         |

### Continuous Harvest

Multiple plantings extend your harvest:

| Succession Plantings             | Result                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Lettuce: April 1, 15, 29, May 13 | Harvest May through July       |
| Beans: May 15, June 1, June 15   | Harvest July through September |

## Best Crops for Succession

### Excellent for Succession

| Crop         | Interval  | Reason                          |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Lettuce      | 2-3 weeks | Quick maturity, bolts in heat   |
| Radishes     | 1-2 weeks | Very fast, small harvest window |
| Beans        | 2-3 weeks | Bush types have limited harvest |
| Spinach      | 2-3 weeks | Quick to bolt                   |
| Cilantro     | 2-3 weeks | Bolts quickly                   |
| Salad greens | 2 weeks   | Cut-and-come-again limited      |

### Good for Succession

| Crop      | Interval  | Reason                         |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Carrots   | 3-4 weeks | Store well but fresh is better |
| Beets     | 3-4 weeks | Continuous baby beets          |
| Peas      | 2 weeks   | Weather dependent              |
| Corn      | 2 weeks   | For longer sweet corn season   |
| Cucumbers | 3-4 weeks | Production declines with age   |

### Poor for Succession

| Crop          | Why Not                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Tomatoes      | Long season, continuous producer |
| Peppers       | Continuous harvest once started  |
| Winter squash | Long season, stores well         |
| Garlic        | One planting per year            |
| Potatoes      | Stores well                      |

## Planning Successions in SowTempo

### Method 1: Duplicate Plantings

1. Create your first planting
2. Open the planting and click **Duplicate**
3. Adjust the planting dates
4. Save as a new planting
5. Repeat for each succession

### Method 2: Multiple Plantings at Once

1. Click **+ Add Planting**
2. Create the first succession
3. Before saving, click **Add Another Succession**
4. Set the interval
5. Choose number of successions
6. All plantings created at once

### Viewing Successions on Calendar

Succession plantings appear as multiple blocks on the calendar:

- Each sowing shows as a separate entry
- Staggered across the season
- Easy to see the pattern

## Calculating Intervals

### Days to Maturity Method

Space plantings by days to maturity divided by desired harvest weeks:

**Example: Lettuce (45 days)**

- Want 4 weeks of continuous harvest
- 45 days ÷ 4 = ~11 days between plantings
- Round to 2-week intervals for simplicity

### Harvest Window Method

Consider how long one planting produces:

| Crop       | Harvest Window | Suggested Interval |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Lettuce    | 1-2 weeks      | 2 weeks            |
| Spinach    | 2-3 weeks      | 3 weeks            |
| Bush beans | 2-3 weeks      | 2-3 weeks          |
| Pole beans | 6-8 weeks      | N/A (continuous)   |

## Season Constraints

### Spring Plantings

Not all successions work all season:

- **Cool-season crops** — Stop before summer heat
- Lettuce: Last sowing 6-8 weeks before hot weather
- Peas: Stop when temps regularly exceed 75°F

### Fall Plantings

Resume cool-season successions in late summer:

- Calculate back from first frost
- Allow time for maturity
- Start 8-10 weeks before first frost

### All-Season Crops

Some crops handle the whole season:

- Beans (with heat-tolerant varieties)
- Carrots
- Beets
- Many herbs

## Tracking Successions

### Label Clearly

Name your successions distinctively:

- "Lettuce - Sow 1 (April 1)"
- "Lettuce - Sow 2 (April 15)"
- "Lettuce - Sow 3 (April 29)"

### Use Garden Layout

Assign each succession to a specific location:

- Helps track what's planted where
- Plan space rotation
- Avoid confusion at harvest

### Monitor Progress

Each succession has its own:

- Planting dates
- Tasks
- Harvest records
- Status tracking

## Tips for Success

### Start Small

First time succession planting?

- Start with one or two crops
- Master the rhythm before expanding
- Track what works

### Be Flexible

Adjust based on:

- Weather conditions
- How quickly you're using produce
- Pest or disease pressure
- Garden space

### Account for Failures

Not every succession will succeed:

- Plan for some losses
- Have backup seeds ready
- Don't get discouraged

### Use Heat-Tolerant Varieties

For continuous lettuce/greens:

- Plant bolt-resistant varieties in summer
- Use heat-tolerant spinach alternatives (like New Zealand spinach)
- Provide shade if needed

### Track Results

Use the Journal to note:

- Which successions performed best
- When bolting occurred
- Pest timing
- Harvest quality over time

## Sample Succession Plan

A simple succession schedule for a 10-week spring:

| Week | Lettuce          | Radishes | Beans |
| ---- | ---------------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1    | Sow 1            | Sow 1    | —     |
| 2    | —                | Sow 2    | —     |
| 3    | Sow 2            | Sow 3    | —     |
| 4    | —                | Sow 4    | Sow 1 |
| 5    | Sow 3            | —        | —     |
| 6    | —                | —        | Sow 2 |
| 7    | Sow 4            | —        | —     |
| 8    | —                | —        | Sow 3 |
| 9    | —                | —        | —     |
| 10   | (stop - too hot) | —        | —     |
