# Planning Your Garden

This guide walks you through the complete process of planning a vegetable garden in SowTempo, from initial setup to a complete planting schedule.

## Overview

A well-planned garden considers:

1. **Space** — What you have to work with
2. **Climate** — What will grow in your zone
3. **Timing** — When to plant each crop
4. **Goals** — What you want to harvest

Let's work through each step.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Location

Before planning, ensure your location is configured:

1. Go to **Settings > Location & Climate**
2. Enter your ZIP code or city
3. Verify your **hardiness zone**
4. Confirm your **frost dates**

![Location Setup](/img/screenshots/guide-location-setup.png)

Accurate frost dates are the foundation of your planting schedule. If you know your microclimate differs from the averages, adjust the dates.

## Step 2: Create a Growing Season

If you haven't already, create a season:

1. Go to **Seasons**
2. Click **+ New Season**
3. Name it (e.g., "2025 Garden")
4. Confirm frost dates
5. Click **Create**

This season will hold all your plantings and records.

## Step 3: Design Your Garden Layout

Before adding plants, map your physical garden:

### Open Garden Layout

Go to **Garden Layout** to access the visual designer.

### Draw Your Beds

Use the drawing tools to create beds matching your garden:

1. **Select Rectangle Tool (B)** for rectangular beds
2. Click and drag to draw each bed
3. Set actual dimensions in the Inspector
4. Name each bed (e.g., "Raised Bed 1", "Front Border")

![Draw Beds](/img/screenshots/guide-draw-beds.png)

### Tips for Layout

- Draw beds to scale using real measurements
- Include paths (as negative space between beds)
- Consider sun exposure when positioning
- Leave access room around all sides

## Step 4: Decide What to Grow

Now choose your crops. Consider:

### Your Goals

What do you want from your garden?

- **Fresh eating** — Tomatoes, cucumbers, salad greens
- **Preserving** — Paste tomatoes, beans, squash
- **Maximum yield** — High-producing crops
- **Learning** — Try new varieties

### Your Climate

Filter the database for your zone:

1. Go to **Vegetables**
2. Set the **Zone Compatibility** filter
3. Browse suitable varieties

### Your Space

Consider plant sizes:

- **Large plants** — Tomatoes, squash, corn need room
- **Vertical growers** — Beans, cucumbers can climb
- **Compact crops** — Lettuce, radishes fit anywhere

### Frost Tolerance

Match plant hardiness to your season length:

| Tolerance   | When to Plant               | Examples           |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Very Hardy  | 4+ weeks before last frost  | Garlic, spinach    |
| Hardy       | 2-4 weeks before last frost | Peas, kale         |
| Half Hardy  | Around last frost           | Lettuce, brassicas |
| Tender      | After last frost            | Beans, squash      |
| Very Tender | 2+ weeks after last frost   | Tomatoes, peppers  |

## Step 5: Create Your Planting Schedule

Add each crop to your schedule:

### Adding Plantings

1. Go to **Planting Schedule**
2. Click **+ Add Planting**
3. Search for your vegetable
4. Select a variety (or use generic)
5. Choose planting method
6. Review calculated dates
7. Assign to a garden bed
8. Save

![Add Planting](/img/screenshots/guide-add-planting.png)

### Recommended First Plantings

If you're new to gardening, start with forgiving crops:

| Crop     | Why It's Easy                     | Planting Method |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Lettuce  | Quick harvest, tolerates mistakes | Direct sow      |
| Radishes | Ready in 30 days                  | Direct sow      |
| Beans    | Almost always succeed             | Direct sow      |
| Tomatoes | Rewarding harvest                 | Transplant      |
| Zucchini | Prolific producer                 | Direct sow      |
| Herbs    | Continuous harvest                | Transplant      |

### Don't Overplan

It's better to grow 5 things well than 20 things poorly. You can always expand next season.

## Step 6: Add Plant Placements to Layout

Connect your schedule to your physical layout:

1. Go to **Garden Layout**
2. Select a bed
3. Choose the **Plant Tool (A)**
4. Click in the bed to add a placement
5. Select the vegetable from your schedule
6. Configure spacing and count

This shows exactly where each plant goes.

## Step 7: Review Your Calendar

Check the full-year view:

1. Go to **Planting Schedule**
2. Scan the calendar for:
   - Gaps in activity
   - Overlapping busy periods
   - Harvest timing

### Balance Your Workload

Spread planting activities so you're not overwhelmed:

- Don't start all seeds the same week
- Stagger direct sowing over multiple dates
- Leave buffer time for weather delays

### Ensure Continuous Harvest

Look for harvest gaps and fill them:

- Add succession plantings of quick crops
- Include crops with different maturity times
- Plant both early and late varieties

## Step 8: Print Your Plan

Create reference materials:

### Garden Layout PDF

1. Go to **Garden Layout**
2. Click **Export > PDF**
3. Include bed names and plant labels
4. Print and post in your garden

### Schedule Export

1. Go to **Planting Schedule**
2. Click **Export > PDF**
3. Keep a copy for reference

## Planning Tips

### Start Small

First-year gardens should be manageable:

- 4-6 different crops maximum
- Focus on varieties you'll eat
- Plan for learning, not perfection

### Consider Companions

Some plants grow well together:

- Tomatoes + basil
- Beans + corn + squash (Three Sisters)
- Carrots + onions

Some should be separated:

- Tomatoes and brassicas
- Beans and alliums

### Plan for Succession

For continuous harvest:

- Plant lettuce every 2-3 weeks
- Stagger bean sowings
- Plant early and late varieties

### Leave Room

Don't pack beds too tight:

- Plants need airflow
- You need access for harvesting
- Some crops (squash) spread

### Use Your Data

If you've gardened before:

- Review last year's analytics
- Note what succeeded and failed
- Adjust varieties and timing

## Sample First Garden

Here's a simple first-year plan:

| Crop     | Quantity | Bed   | Method     |
| -------- | -------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Tomatoes | 4 plants | Bed 1 | Transplant |
| Peppers  | 4 plants | Bed 1 | Transplant |
| Lettuce  | 2 rows   | Bed 2 | Direct sow |
| Beans    | 1 row    | Bed 2 | Direct sow |
| Zucchini | 2 plants | Bed 3 | Direct sow |
| Basil    | 4 plants | Bed 1 | Transplant |

This provides:

- Fresh salads (lettuce)
- Main dishes (tomatoes, peppers, beans)
- Side dishes (zucchini)
- Flavor (basil)
