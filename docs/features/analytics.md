| Tab             | Purpose                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Harvest**     | Yield and productivity analysis |
| **Planting**    | Schedule and status breakdown   |
| **Weather**     | Climate patterns and trends     |
| **Utilization** | Garden space usage              |
| **Forecast**    | Predictions and projections     |

## Harvest Analytics

Analyze your yields and productivity:

### Yield by Vegetable

Bar chart showing total harvest by vegetable type:

- Compare production across crops
- Identify your best producers
- Spot underperformers
