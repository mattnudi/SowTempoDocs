# Season Management

Seasons in SowTempo represent distinct growing periods, typically one per year. Each season has its own plantings, harvests, and records, allowing you to track progress and compare performance across years.

![Seasons Overview](/img/screenshots/seasons-overview.png)

## Understanding Seasons

A **growing season** is the period between your last spring frost and first fall frost. In SowTempo, each season:

- Has its own frost dates
- Contains independent plantings and schedules
- Tracks separate harvests and records
- Can be compared with other seasons

Only one season is **active** at a time. The active season is what you see in Dashboard, Planting Schedule, and Garden Layout.

## Viewing Seasons

Navigate to **Seasons** in the sidebar to see all your seasons:

### Season Cards

Each season displays:

| Field              | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Name**           | Season name (e.g., "2025 Garden") |
| **Year**           | Calendar year                     |
| **Last Frost**     | Spring frost date                 |
| **First Frost**    | Fall frost date                   |
| **Status**         | Active, Inactive, or Archived     |
| **Planting Count** | Number of plantings this season   |

![Create Season](/img/screenshots/seasons-create.png)

### Required Fields

| Field                | Description                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Season Name**      | Descriptive name for this season |
| **Year**             | The calendar year                |
| **Last Frost Date**  | When spring frost risk ends      |
| **First Frost Date** | When fall frost risk begins      |

### Frost Date Options

Set frost dates using one of these methods:

1. **Auto-lookup** — Based on your ZIP code or location
2. **Manual entry** — Pick specific dates
3. **Copy from previous** — Use last year's dates

:::tip
If you're creating a season for next year, the auto-lookup will use historical averages. Adjust once you have current forecasts.
:::

### Copy from Previous Season

When creating a new season, you can copy data from an existing season:

- **Copy frost dates** — Use same frost timing
- **Copy plantings** — Duplicate your planting schedule
- **Copy garden layout** — Duplicate bed arrangements

This is useful for maintaining consistency year over year.

## Activating a Season

Only one season can be active at a time. The active season is displayed throughout the app.

### To Activate a Season

1. Find the season in the list
2. Click **Activate** or the activation button
3. The season becomes active immediately

When you activate a season:

- Dashboard shows that season's data
- Planting Schedule displays that season's plantings
- Garden Layout shows that season's beds
- Tasks reflect that season's activities

![Activate Season](/img/screenshots/seasons-activate.png)

## Editing Seasons

### Opening the Editor

Click **Edit** on any season card to modify it.

### Editable Properties

- Season name
- Frost dates
- Notes

:::warning
Changing frost dates will affect calculated planting dates for all plantings in that season. Review your schedule after making changes.
:::

## Archiving Seasons

Archive seasons you're no longer actively working with:

1. Click **Archive** on the season card
2. Confirm the action

### What Archiving Does

- Removes the season from the main list
- Preserves all data (plantings, harvests, records)
- Season can still be viewed and reactivated

### Viewing Archived Seasons

Toggle **Show Archived** to see archived seasons.

### Unarchiving

Click **Unarchive** on any archived season to restore it to the active list.

## Duplicating Seasons

Create a new season based on an existing one:

1. Click **Duplicate** on a season card
2. Choose what to copy:
   - Frost dates
   - Plantings
   - Garden layout
3. Set the new year
4. Click **Create**

This is the fastest way to set up a new year with your established garden plan.

## Deleting Seasons

:::danger
Deleting a season permanently removes all associated data:

- Plantings
- Harvests
- Tasks
- Journal entries
- All records linked to that season

This cannot be undone.
:::

### To Delete a Season

1. Click **Delete** on the season card
2. Type the season name to confirm
3. Click **Delete Permanently**

## Season Comparison

Compare performance across seasons in the Analytics section:

1. Go to **Analytics**
2. Select **Season Comparison**
3. Choose seasons to compare
4. View metrics side by side

You can compare:

- Total harvests
- Yield by vegetable
- Planting timing
- Success rates

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent, descriptive names:

- "2025 Main Garden"
- "Spring 2025"
- "Backyard Garden 2025"

### When to Create Seasons

Create a new season when:

- A new calendar year begins
- You want to track a distinct growing period
- You're starting a new garden location

### Planning Ahead

Create next year's season before the current one ends:

1. Duplicate current season
2. Adjust frost dates if needed
3. Modify plantings based on lessons learned
4. Have your plan ready before spring
