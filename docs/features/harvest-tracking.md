## Harvest Analytics

Your harvest data feeds into Analytics:

### Yield Charts

- Peak harvest periods
- Year-over-year comparisons (when data available)

See [Analytics](/docs/features/analytics) for more details.

## Tips for Harvest Tracking

1. **Log immediately** — Record harvests when you pick, not later
2. **Be consistent** — Use the same units for the same crops
3. **Note quality** — Quality ratings reveal growing issues
4. **Add notes** — Record anything unusual for future reference
5. **Review regularly** — Check analytics to learn from your data

### What to Track

Prioritize tracking:

- **High-value crops** — Tomatoes, peppers, squash
- **Prolific producers** — Beans, greens, cucumbers
- **Learning crops** — New varieties you're testing

You don't need to weigh every single lettuce leaf, but consistent tracking of main crops provides valuable insights.
